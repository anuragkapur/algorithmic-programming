Sorting Algorithms
==================

Insertion Sort
--------------

* Best Case running time: Θ(n)
* Worst Case running time: Θ(n^2)
* Space complexity: Sorts in place!

Merge Sort
----------

* Running times: Best case = avergae case = worst case = Θ(n log n) 
* Running time recurrence

T(n) =  c 				for n=1
		2T(n/2) + cn 	for n>1
		
* Space complexity: Does not sort in space. > Θ(n)

Heap Sort
---------

* Running times: Best case = average case = worst case = O(n log n)
* Space complexity: Sorts in place! => O(1)

Quick Sort
----------

* Average case running time: O(n log n)
* Worst case running time: O(n^2)
* Space complexity: Sorts in place

Selection Sort
--------------

* Best Case running time: Θ(n)
* Worst Case running time: Θ(n^2)
* Space complexity: Sorts in place!
