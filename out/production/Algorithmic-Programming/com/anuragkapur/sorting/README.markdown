Sorting Algorithms
==================

Insertion Sort
--------------

* Best Case running time: Θ(n)
* Worst Case running time: Θ(n^2)
* Space complexity: Sorts in space!

Merge Sort
----------

* Running times: Best case = avergae case = worst case = Θ(n log n) 
* Running time recurrence

T(n) =  c 				for n=1
		2T(n/2) + cn 	for n>1
		
* Space complexity: Does not sort in space. > Θ(n)
